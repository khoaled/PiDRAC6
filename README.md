# PiDRAC6
A Docker container for iDRAC6 on your Raspberry Pi!

I've used code from https://github.com/DomiStyle/docker-idrac6 to base this project off of.  It's using the alpine image from https://hub.docker.com/r/didierc/baseimage-gui.  

Things that aren't working:
  1.  Virtual Media
  2.  KVM native library for keyboard and mouse.
